<h2> About me:</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Salvador Max Jr. I'm a firefighter at the Corozal Fire Station and is currently pursuing my Associate's Degree<br>

<h2>Life Goals:</h2>
<p>My life goal is to open a water dispensary at Teakettle Village, where I was born and raised. I want to own<br>
my business and be my boss. I will be considering retirement from my work when I complete 25 years of service to my country.</p>
<h2>My Philosophy:</h2>  
<p>I don't desire to be rich, but rather to live a comfortable life with my family, especially taking care of my parents. </p>
<h2>Best friend:</h2>
